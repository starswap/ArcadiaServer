## To finalise the project:
- Diagnose and fix errors on map page (server/client combination - maybe choose a different API)
- Finish the Flappy bird game and add put in same format as the other one - add a wildlife theme
- Finish the space invaders game - the animals need to drop down and there needs to be blockers
- Timeouts once the user has played the game: force appreciation of the natural environment in which they find themself
- Improve README.md
- Deal effectively with overlapping circles
- Ensure all pages including badges can be accessed from everywhere via navigation links
- Add high scores
- Make sure that once the user has finished the game the changes to session[] are removed so they can't play it again if this is necessary
- Adjust frequency of update so that location updates more frequently than circles
- Publish somewhere, e.g. to Google Play
- Make play game require login?
